            <p>As of late my most used programming language is C++, mainly because it is used widely in A&M's Computer Science curriculum. 
            Java was my first language, the main one I used throughout high school. I tought some basic coding classes using the language.
            I am relatively familiar with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Currently trying to improve my skills involving those.
            I have used C and Scheme in some college courses, but only have basic exposure to those languages.
            I am familiar with Linux, Git, and LaTeX through college coursework.
            I have used Node.js, Maven, and NumPy lightly in a few projects. </p>

            <p>Technical areas of interest in Computer Science include machine learning, artificial intelligence, blockchain technology, and cybersecurity. 
                These topics are all very interesting to me and seems like they are constantly developing with the future. I am always willing to learn more and follow news related to them. 
                Other than that I am interested in front-end, back-end, and full-stack development. To be honest I have not had enough experience to determine which I'd like to specialize in.
                Game development also intrigues me as I have always enjoyed video gaming.
            </p>
