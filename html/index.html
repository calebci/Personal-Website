      <p>My name is Caleb Ci and I am a junior at <a href="https://www.tamu.edu/">Texas A&M University</a> pursuing a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science.</p>
      <p>Computers have been a part of my life from a very young age. When I was 8 years old I would sit in my father's office and mess around with his laptop, playing web games or exploring the internet. I started making money on the internet when I was 10 years old, finding random, inconsistent side-hustles throughout the years even up until today. I built my first PC with money I had earned when I was 15, and my latest PC last year. Computers have always been extremely important to me, which is why I chosen to study them in college and pursue a related career.</p>
      <p>I started studying computer science 8 years ago, early in my high school years. My first programming language was Java, which ties in with my first coding-related work experience where I was an online instructor, teaching the basics of object oriented programming at a summer camp. Other than that I do not have much work experience related to coding, but I have been working on school and personal projects to hone my skills and prepare for my future career. I am Self-directed and motivated to gain more knowledge in the industry. I'm a fast learner and adept with modern technologies. I'm a good communicator, problem solver, and excel in team environments. Currently targeting a Summer 2023 internship involving software engineering, web development, UI/UX, data sciences, or cybersecurity to apply my knowledge to solve real world problems and make a difference.</p>
      <p>Some personal hobbies and interests of mine include watching TV shows and movies, primarily star wars, DC/Marvel, and various anime. I also play and stream video games, primarily first-person shooters like VALORANT or CS:GO. I also enjoy working out and swimming.</p>
