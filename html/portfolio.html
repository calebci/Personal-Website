      <h2>Krunker.io Stats Twitch Chat Bot</h2>
      <p>JavaScript, Node.js, HTML/CSS</p>
      <a href="https://github.com/calebci/KrunkerStatsBot">Github Repository </a>
      <ul>
        <li>Designed Twitch chat bot with Node.js and JavaScript that uses Krunker API to scrape account stats from <a href="http://krunker.io">Krunker.io (web game)</a> and output a specific stat to the chat based on user input</li>
        <li>Developed a front-end web application with HTML/CSS and JavaScript for users to configure the specific commands they want enable on their Twitch channel</li>
        <li>Distributed chat bot to 20+ Twitch Streamers for a simple method to display their account stats in their channel's chat</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Minecraft Spigot Plugin</h2>
      <p>Java, Maven</p>
      <a href="https://github.com/calebci/MCTest">Github Repository</a>
      <ul>
        <li>Developed Java Minecraft plugin using Spigot API with Maven, implementing 10+ features that modified the game for fun</li>
        <li>Built a locally hosted Minecraft Spigot server to test and use the plugin</li>
        <li>Plugin is primarily used for sandbox/testing purposes and is actively being updated</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Simulated CPU</h2>
      <p>Logisim, C</p>
      <a href="https://github.com/JPham-file/y86-Processor">Github Repository</a>
      <ul>
        <li>Designed functional Y86 processor and implemented full instruction set architecture and all data path elements with digital logic and circuits simulated in Logisim</li>
        <li>Developed 3 programs in C and created binary files to test processor state changes and ensure functionality</li>
        <li>This project was a group class project, and I primarily focused on building the ALU</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Dungeon Crawler</h2>
      <p>C++</p>
      <a href="https://github.com/calebci/DungeonCrawler">Github Repository</a>
      <ul>
        <li>Designed a top-down, choice-based game that runs on terminal using command-line inputs </li>
        <li>Implemented functions to load map data from files into dynamic 2D arrays which change based on 8 possible user inputs, game logic implemented for multiple levels, rooms, doors & keys, obstacles, and monster attacks</li>
        <li>Yes this project is not very unique to TAMU students, but it was one of my first somewhat complex C++ projects and games are cool so why not</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Content Aware Image Resizing</h2>
      <p>C++</p>
      <a href="https://github.com/calebci/SeamCarving">Github Repository</a>
      <ul>
        <li>Implemented process for resizing images through “seam carving” where each pixel from an image of portable pixel map (.ppm) file type is loaded into a 2D array and energy for each pixel is calculated</li>
        <li>Coded a greedy algorithm to determine and remove vertical seam with least energy, process is repeated to resize image</li>
        <li>Another 121 Project which I personally found very interesting and enjoyed learning/programming the concept</li>
      </ul>
